										<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
									</header>

									<p><b></b></p>

									<p><b><u>Overview</u></b></p>
									<p>⬇</p>

									<p><b>Nowadays smartphones always by our side, but we often use it for social media and entertainment, why not we use it to help students better manage their study by using different types of application as a study aid. My project will be developing a mobile all-in-one study application mainly for students, teachers and parents. It mainly uses to track down all the courses, classes and assignments in school or university for students. For teachers, it also helps to manage with different courses of different grades & classes. Not only that, parents can use the application if they would like to take care or keep track of their kid's study status.</b></p>

									<p><b><u>Motivation</u></b></p>
									<p>⬇</p>

									<p><b>The study application is really interesting and useful, it involved various of powerful features with user-friendly interface to help students manage their class time and assignment due date, make students learning life easier and efficiency. After I have done some research, nowadays actually study application is really common for students.</b></p>

									<p><b>Based on Education Technology (2017), " 87% of 1,294 students surveyed said that they use apps to help them study. Of the majority, the primary reason for using apps was to remember deadlines as that reduces stress dramatically and allows them to plan work accordingly."</b></p>

									<p><b>__________</p></b>

									<p><b>According to Education Technology (2017), “94% of the UK population owning smartphones.”. Majority of the people have smartphones, so for most of the people, there is no point not using a study application.</b></p>


									<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uiCz0Ef.png" alt="Research 2" width="700" height="500"></center>
								<p><b>__________</p></b>

									<p><b><u>Description</u></b></p>
									<p>⬇</p>

									<p><b>The features of the study app include helps the student to organize their class time, exam date & time, users allow to input and manage their courses, classes and exams. All the inputted classes will be displayed in a week-view calendar. It improves users time management skill. It also helps users to manage assignment due date, like setting a reminder for their homework or any tasks. Users can either organize their assignments by date, by course or by priority or sort them by completed or uncompleted. All the inputted assignments will be displayed in the week-view calendar as well. The application has a powerful notification feature, whenever a user has inputted classes or assignments with due date, by default 24 hours before that, it will send a notification to the user, the time range can set by the user, so this is similar to a reminder, mainly used to make sure students will not miss their class and assignment.</b></p>


									<p><b>Not only that, the application also has a simple note-taking feature, users can create and rename digital notebooks for a specific subject, create pages with title and allow users to change different paper style, type, write, highlight, draw and insert photos on pages, it also have document scanning feature, allow users to take photo on a document or any notes, crop the photos and auto enhancing make the texts or image look clearer and sharper, allow it to insert to a specific page of a digital notebook.</b></p>


									<p><b>Other than that, users can register a free account for this app with a username, email address and password set to unlock some features, after users registered an account, they can manage their profile like update their name, school and profile picture. One of the locked features is gives users the ability to sync all the contents across different devices like class timetables, assignment due dates, notebooks and so on. All users need do is to register an account and sign in in different devices, users can view all the contents across different devices. The next locked feature is the GPS feature, use to search the nearby best study location like the nearby library. Last but not least, this application is available in iOS and Android both operating systems.</b></p>


									<p><b><u>Tools and Technologies</u></b></p>
									<p>⬇</p>

									<p><b>In order to develop the mobile application, I need to have a minimum laptop or desktop with Windows or MacOS and with standard specifications like Intel i5 or i7, 8 to 16 GB ram and 500GB or more disk storage, I will choose to have a MacOS device because it can develop both iOS and Android application, iOS development software only runs on Apple Macs. I also need to have WI-FI high-speed internet. Not only that, I need to have a few models of mobile for each platform iOS and Android, use to test the application. Next, I need to have developer software for MacOS, Xcode for building iOS app and Android Studio for building Android app.</b></p>


									<p><b><u>Skills Required</u></b></p>
									<p>⬇</p>

									<p><b>In order to develop the mobile application, I need to have good programming skill, expert on at least one programming language like Java, C++, Python, Swift and etc. So that we can use the development software like Xcode and Android Studio to build the application. To build a high-quality user interface application, I need to have good User Interface Design and User Experience Design skill, provide users a good looking, user-friendly, efficiency and smooth experience application, it makes users have good interaction with the application. I also need to have good database management skill, to manage the data collected from the users, if possible, create the most efficient databases and repositories.</b></p>

									<p><b><u>Outcome</u></b></p>
									<p>⬇</p>

									<p><b>Students used to study with different types study applications, if the project is successful, more and more people will use the all-in-one study application, mainly help a lot of students better manage their study and make students learning life easier and efficiency. The original problem is solved when I have good programming skills, expert in programming languages, have good database management skill and expert in UI/UX design skill to make the application more user-friendly and efficiency. This development will impact the education society, make most of the students use the all-in-one study application every day, make it become a habit to organize their studies and get good results in the exam and make the academic world better.</b></p>
